<summary>Local development</summary>

To serve the site locally, you need a couple of prerequisites (`pipx`, `poetry` 
and `python >= 3.11 < 3.13`)

### `pipx`

Install `pipx`

```bash
python -m pip install --user pipx
```

which will throw a warning that `pipx` is not on Path. Navigate to the 
path mentioned in the warning and execute

```bash
.\pipx.exe ensurepath
```

### `poetry`

In a new terminal, install `poetry`

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

### Project setup

To install all project dependencies, navigate to the project root and execute

```bash
poetry install
```

### Serve the site (on Windows)

... with

```bash
.\serve-local.bat
```

which will build and serve the site. The script is just a convenience wrapper
to disable the `git-committers` plugin for local builds which should reduce the
build time by a couple of seconds.

The site is served at `localhost:8000`
