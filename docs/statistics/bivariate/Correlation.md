# Measures of Correlation

This chapter covers the measures of linear relationships, specifically covariance and correlation. These measures help in characterizing the linear relationship between two variables, if such a relationship exists.

## Covariance

In the previous univariate parts, the metrics focused only on a single variable. Covariance allows us to determine the **relationship between two variables**. 



???+ defi "Definition: Covariance"

    \[
    \text{cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x}) \cdot (y_i - \bar{y})}{N}
    \]

    where \(X\) and \(Y\) are variables consisting of \(N\) values, and \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \) are their respective means.  

The name suggests that it is a type of 'variance,' as \( \text{cov}(X, X) = \sigma^2(X) \).


```py
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.tips()

Covariance = df['total_bill'].cov(df['tip'], ddof=0)
print(f"Covariance: {Covariance}")
```

```title=">>> Output"
8.29
```

By default, the degree of freedom `#!python ddof=1`. In this case the population formular will be used. For the sample formular, the `#!python ddof=0` needs to be set.


???+ example "Example: Covariance of House Price" 
    Given is a table with the size and price of houses. Determine the covariance.

    ``` py
    size = [60, 72, 111, 67, 90]
    price = [330000, 490000, 600000, 400000, 455000]
    ```

    ---
    *Solution* 

    \[
    \bar{x} = 80 \, \text{m}^2 \quad \bar{y} = 455,000 \, \text{€}
    \]

    \[
    \begin{eqnarray*}
						cov(X,Y)&=&\frac{[(60-80)\cdot(330k-455k)]+[(72-80)\cdot(490k-455k)]+[(111-80)\cdot(600k-455k)]}{5}\\
						&&+\frac{[(67-80)\cdot(400k-455k)]+[(90-80)\cdot(455k-455k)]}{5}\\
						&=&1,486,000 \, \text{m}^2\text{€}
				\end{eqnarray*}
    \]

    The covariance between \(X\) and \(Y\) is \(1,486,000 \, \text{m}^2\text{€}\).

    ??? code "Code"
        ``` py
        import pandas as pd

        # Create a DataFrame
        df = pd.DataFrame([(60, 330000), (72, 490000), (111, 600000), (67, 400000) , (90, 455000)], columns=['size', 'price'])

        # Calculate covariance
        house_cov = df['size'].cov(df['price'], ddof=0) # ddof=0 --> Formlar for sample | ddof=1 --> Formlar for population (default)
        print(f"Covariance: {house_cov}")
        ```

**Interpretation of Covariance:**  

- Covariance indicates the **direction of the relationship**:
    - \(>0\): Positive relationship (if \(X\) increases, \(Y\) increases)
    - \(=0\): No relationship
    - \(<0\): Negative relationship (if \(X\) increases, \(Y\) decreases)
- Covariance does not provide information about the **strength** of the relationship since it is not dimensionless.
- To quantify the strength, we use a normalized measure called the correlation coefficient.  

## Correlation Coefficient

### Pearson

The Pearson correlation coefficient expresses both the **direction and strength** of the linear relationship between two variables. It is a normalized form of covariance and is **symmetric**: \( \rho_{X,Y} = \rho_{Y,X} \).

???+ defi "Definition: Pearson  Correlation Coefficient"

    \[
    \rho = \frac{\text{cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_x \cdot \sigma_y}
    \]

    where \(X\) and \(Y\) are metric variables, \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_y \) are their standard deviations, and \( \text{cov}(X, Y) \) is the covariance. 


```py
Pearson = df['total_bill'].corr(df['tip'],method='pearson')
print(f"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {Pearson}")
```

```title=">>> Output"
0.68
```

???+ example example "Example: Pearson Correlation Cofficient of House Price" 
    Given is a table with the size and price of houses. 
    ``` py
    size = [60, 72, 111, 67, 90]
    price = [330000, 490000, 600000, 400000, 455000]
    ```
    Additionally, we already know:

    \[
    \text{cov}(X, Y) = 1,486,000 \quad \sigma_x = 18.4 \quad \sigma_y = 90,443
    \]
 
    Determine the Pearson correlation coefficient.

    ---
    *Solution* 

    \[
    \rho = \frac{1,486,000}{18.4 \cdot 90,443} = 0.89
    \]

    The correlation coefficient between \(X\) and \(Y\) is \(0.89\).

    ??? code "Code"
        ``` py
        import pandas as pd

        # Create a DataFrame
        df = pd.DataFrame([(60, 330000), (72, 490000), (111, 600000), (67, 400000) , (90, 455000)], columns=['size', 'price'])

        # Calculate pearson correlation coefficient
        house_pearson = df['size'].corr(df['price'],method='pearson')
        print(f"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {house_pearson}")
        ```

**Interpretation of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient :**  

- The Pearson correlation coefficient has no dimesion.
- Its value ranges between \([-1 \dots 1]\) (according to the standard terminology by Jacob Cohen, 1988):
    - \(0\): No correlation
    - \(> \pm 0.1\): Weak correlation
    - \(> \pm 0.3\): Moderate correlation
    - \(> \pm 0.5\): Strong correlation
    - \(\pm 1\): Perfect positive/negative correlation (one variable can be derived from the other)

### Spearman

Covariance and the Pearson correlation coefficient require variables to be at least metric. When one of the variables is **ordinal**, the rank correlation should be calculated, with Spearman's method being a common choice. 


```py
Spearman = df['total_bill'].corr(df['tip'],method='spearman')
print(f"Spearman Correlation Coefficient: {Spearman}")
```

```title=">>> Output"
0.68
```

In order for `#!python df.corr()` to deal with ordinal data, the input needs to be numeric. This means that for ordinal data consisting of letters, the data needs to be mapped: 

```py
day_order = {
    'Thur' : 4, 
    'Fri'  : 5, 
    'Sat'  : 6,
    'Sun'  : 7
    }
df['day_ord'] = df['day'].map(day_order)

Spearman = df['day_ord'].corr(df['size'],method='spearman')
print(f"Spearman Correlation Coefficient: {Spearman}")
```

```title=">>> Output"
0.24
```


The interpretation of Spearman's rank correlation is similar to Pearson's.

???+ defi "Definition: Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient"

    \[
    \rho_s = 1 - \frac{6 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i^2}{N^3 - N} \quad \text{where } d_i = R(x_i) - R(y_i)
    \]

    with \(X\) and \(Y\) as variables consisting of \(N\) values and ranks \(R(x_i)\) and \(R(y_i)\).  

**Rank Formation**

- The rank corresponds to the position a value holds when all values are arranged in order.

    ???+ example "Example: Ranking of Values" 
    
        | \(x_i\)   | 2.17 | 8.00 | 1.09 | 2.01 |
        |-----------|------|------|------|------|
        | \(R(x_i)\)| 3    | 4    | 1    | 2    |

- For identical values, the average rank (mean of the relevant ranks) is used.

    ???+ example "Example: Ranking of Equal Values" 
        | \(x_i\) | 1.09 | 2.17 | 2.17 | 2.17 | 3.02 | 4.50 |
        |---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
        | \(R(x_i)\)| 1    | 3    | 3    | 3    | 5    | 6    |

        with \( (2+3+4)/3 = 3 \)



???+ example example "Example: Spearman Correlation Coefficient of House Price" 
    Given is a table with the size and price of houses. 
    ``` py
    size = [60, 72, 111, 67, 90]
    price = [330000, 490000, 600000, 400000, 455000]
    ``` 
    Determine the Spearman correlation coefficient.

    ---
    *Solution* 

    | Size | R(Size) | Price | R(Price) | \( d_i \) |
    |------|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
    | 60   | 1       | 330k  | 1        | 0         |
    | 72   | 3       | 490k  | 4        | -1        |
    | 111  | 5       | 600k  | 5        | 0         |
    | 67   | 2       | 400k  | 2        | 0         |
    | 90   | 4       | 455k  | 3        | 1         |

    \[
    \rho_s = 1 - \frac{6 \cdot [0^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2]}{5^3 - 5} = 0.9
    \]

    The Spearman correlation coefficient between \(X\) and \(Y\) is \(0.9\).

    ??? code "Code"
        ``` py
        import pandas as pd

        # Create a DataFrame
        df = pd.DataFrame([(60, 330000), (72, 490000), (111, 600000), (67, 400000) , (90, 455000)], columns=['size', 'price'])

        # Calculate spearman correlation coefficient
        house_spearman = df['size'].corr(df['price'],method='spearman')
        print(f"Spearman Correlation Coefficient: {house_spearman}")
        ```

## Scatter Plot

A scatter plot provides a **graphical representation** of the relationship between two metric variables on a Cartesian coordinate system. 

```py
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length")
fig.show()
```

Each **data pair** is treated as a **coordinate** and is represented by a point on the plot. This allows for identifying relationships, patterns, or trends between the variables.

            xaxis_title_text='Size',
            yaxis_title_text='Price',
            title=dict(
                    text='<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">House Prices: Scatter Plot</span> <br> <span style="font-size:5">Variables: size, price</span></b>',
                ),
        )

        # Show the plot
        fig.show()
        ```

## Recap

- Measures of linear relationships describe the relationship between two variables.
- Covariance identifies the direction of the relationship between two metrically scaled variables but not the strength.
- The Pearson correlation coefficient measures both the direction and strength of the relationship between two metrically scaled variables.
- If at least one variable is ordinal, the Spearman correlation coefficient is used.
- A scatter plot can visually represent the relationship between two metric variables.  

## Tasks

???+ question "Task: Attribute Correlation"
    Use the following dataset:
    ``` py
    from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo 
    
    # fetch dataset 
    cars = fetch_ucirepo(id=9) 
    # https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg
    
    # data (as pandas dataframes) 
    data = cars.data.features

    # Show the first 5 rows
    data.head()
    ```
    Work on the following task: 

    1. Analyze the correlation between the variables `horsepower` and `cylinders`. Therefore calculate the covariance, pearson correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient. Interpret the results.
    2. Generate a scatter plot for the variabels `horsepower` and `cylinders`. Compare the before result with the calculated measures. 
    3. Take a closer look on the different variables and the corresponding attribute type. Is there a variable, where the calculation of the correlation makes no sense? 

???+ question "Task: Income vs. Expenditures"
    Given below are the incomes and weekly consumption expenditures of four households (sample), each measured in euros:
    ``` py
    # 
    import pandas as pd

    income = [150, 250, 175, 165]
    expenditure = [135, 150, 140, 150]

    # convert the lists to pandaframe
    df = pd.DataFrame({'income': income, 'expenditure': expenditure})
    df.head()
    ```
    Work on the following task: 

    1. Calculate the covariance between `income` and `expenditure`. Interpret the result.
    2. Calculate the covariance when `income` is measured in Euro cents. How does this affect the interpretation?
    3. Switch back to `income` in Euro. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient. Interpret the results.
    4. Calculate the correlation coefficient when income is measured in Euro Cents. How does this affect the interpretation?
