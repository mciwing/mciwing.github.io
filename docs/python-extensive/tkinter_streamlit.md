# Tkinter vs Streamlit

In the previous sections, you explored two different approaches to building graphical user interfaces: **Tkinter** and **Streamlit**.  

On one side, **Tkinter** provided a foundation for creating desktop applications. While its design may feel somewhat outdated, it remains a powerful and widely used tool for GUI programming, sharing core principles with many other frameworks.  

On the other side, you worked with **Streamlit**, a modern, web-based framework designed for rapid prototyping and interactive data applications. Its ease of use and built-in interactivity make it particularly appealing for data-driven projects.  

To round off this chapter on "Graphical User Interfaces," the following comparison highlights key similarities and differences between **Tkinter** and **Streamlit**.  

### Tkinter  
- **GUI framework** for building desktop applications.  
- **Event-driven programming**, requiring more code for UI interactivity.  
- **Highly customizable**, though complex for advanced UIs.  
- **Desktop-only deployment**, requiring a Python environment.  
- **Class-based approach**, where windows, widgets, and events are manually structured.  

### Streamlit  
- **Web-based framework**, ideal for rapid prototyping of data-driven apps.  
- **Real-time interactivity** with minimal setup and coding.  
- **Simplified interface**, offering limited customization but excellent ease of use.  
- **Easy web deployment**, requiring no manual environment setup.  
- **Function-based design**, though class-based structures can be incorporated for reusability.  

???+ info "When to Use What"    
    - **Use Tkinter** if your focus is on building desktop applications with a traditional GUI.    
    - **Use Streamlit** if your goal is to rapidly prototype web apps, particularly in data science or machine learning, where real-time updates and interactivity are crucial.
