    This chapter introduces the package
    [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the swiss-army knife
    for data preprocessing, transformation and machine learning.

    We will continue to work with the Portuguese retail bank data 
    set[^1] and preprocess it further. Alongside we start to explore 
    `scikit-learn`'s functionalities.
