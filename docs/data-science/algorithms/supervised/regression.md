# Regression

In machine learning, we often face the challenge of making predictions based on
patterns in our data. Linear regression, a supervised method addresses 
this by providing a straightforward approach to modeling the relationship 
between variables, allowing us to both explain existing data and make 
predictions with new observations.

This chapter introduces linear regression through practical examples, starting
with a simple mobile plan pricing model and progressing to more nuanced
relationships between variables. We'll explore how to evaluate model
performance using the coefficient of determination (\( R^2 \) ), and understand
the mathematics behind finding the "best fit" line - concepts that form the
foundation for many more sophisticated machine learning algorithms.
