# Introduction

With extensive data preparation knowledge, we can tackle the next
big part of data science: algorithms. An algorithm is a

In data science, algorithms are used to solve problems such as modelling data 
to make prediction for unseen data or clustering data to find patterns.

The following chapters will introduce you to the most common algorithms, like 
linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering. We will
explore the theory as well as practical examples.
First, we establish two main categories of algorithms: supervised and 
unsupervised learning.
