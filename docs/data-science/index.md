Welcome to the `Data Science Course`! :waving_hand:

This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the
field of data science. It is structured into four blocks, each focusing on a
different aspect. All concepts and techniques are demonstrated with code
examples!

## Course overview

1. Basics: Introduction to various terms (data science, machine learning, etc.)
   and data basics such as attribute types.
2. Data Preparation & Preprocessing: Data cleaning, integration, and 
   transformation.
3. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: Exploration of both terms, and 
   coverage of various algorithms.
4. Data Science in Practice: Step-by-step guide to a real-world data science 
   project.

## Tools

As always, we use Python and these great packages :heart:

## Sneak peek

Here is a sneak peek of selected topics we cover in this course:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __:deciduous_tree: Decision trees__ 

    --- 
    
    What are decision trees? How do they work?

        >
    </figure>

-   __:musical_note: Recommender system__ 

    --- 
    
    With a large Spotify data set, we build a recommender system. At the end
    you will be able to recommend songs.

-   __:mechanical_arm: Elbow method__ 

    --- 
    
    We introduce the elbow method and how it can help us to (for example) 
    refine the recommender system.

-   __:chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Science in Practice__ 

    ---

    We present a step-by-step guide to a real-world data science project. 
    The project applies concepts, algorithms and techniques introduced up to 
    this point.

    ... oh, and along the way we cover a different type of transformer.

## Expected outcome

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the data
science field. Additionally, you will be capable of preprocessing real-world
data, selecting and applying appropriate algorithms to solve practical
problems.
