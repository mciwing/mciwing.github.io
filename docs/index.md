## Topics

### :fontawesome-brands-python: Python Crash Course
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- 
    [![header](assets/header/pcc.png)](python/index.md)
    Get started with the basics of the Python programming language. We will
    start from zero - setting up Python on your computer, learning to store and
    work with different types of information, and building up to writing your
    own code. Step by step you will understand fundamental programming concepts
    and by the end, you will be able to write your own simple Python programs.
