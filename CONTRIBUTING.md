## Conventions

### Course Content

When adding or modifying course content, ensure that you look at existing 
pages. Use the same styling, such as admonition boxes, formatting, and 
structure, to ensure uniformity across the project. 
As a reference you can use the [CART chapter](docs/data-science/algorithms/supervised/tree-based/cart/)
which includes code blocks (including highlighting and annotations), formulas,
tables, graphs and images. 

### Commit Messages

If your changes are addressing a particular issue, reference the issue within
your commit message. For example:

```plaintext
git commit -m "docs: added contribution guidelines #97"
```

Issues can be referenced with a `#` and the corresponding issue number.
